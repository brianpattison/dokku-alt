## Requirements

Assumes that you use Ubuntu 14.04 LTS right now. Ideally have a domain ready to point to your host. It's designed for and is probably best to use a fresh VM. The debian package will install everything it needs.

## Installing

    $ sudo bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dokku-alt/dokku-alt/master/bootstrap.sh)"

## Installing (with force-yes)

Sometimes you may want to install dokku-alt completely non-interactive way. Now you can do it. Simply boostrap.sh without terminal:

    $ sudo bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dokku-alt/dokku-alt/master/bootstrap.sh)" < /dev/null

## Configuring

If you use bootstrap script from above at the end it will fireup ruby installation script. Point your browser to `http://<ip>:2000/` and finish configuration.

That's it!

### Manual configuration

Set up a domain and a wildcard domain pointing to that host. Make sure `/home/dokku/VHOST` is set to this domain. By default it's set to whatever hostname the host has. This file is only created if the hostname can be resolved by dig (`dig +short $(hostname -f)`). Otherwise you have to create the file manually and set it to your preferred domain. If this file still is not present when you push your app, dokku will publish the app with a port number (i.e. `http://example.com:49154` - note the missing subdomain).

You'll have to add a public key associated with a username by doing something like this from your local machine:

    $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh dokku.me sudo dokku access:add

## Upgrade and beta releases

Unlike `dokku` this script uses debian packaging system (deb). To upgrade to latest version simply execute: `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install dokku-alt`.

Alongside the normal (stable) releases we distribute as well beta (bleeding edge). To switch to beta simply execute: `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install dokku-alt-beta`. It will replace the stable dokku-alt and switch to beta.

## Migration from dokku

It should be possible, it should mostly work, but it's not tested and advised. VPS are very cheap this days so fire-up new machine and setup `dokku-alt` from the scratch.

## Deploy an App

Now you can deploy apps on your Dokku. Let's deploy the [Heroku Node.js sample app](https://github.com/heroku/node-js-sample). All you have to do is add a remote to name the app. It's created on-the-fly.

    $ git clone https://github.com/heroku/node-js-sample
    $ cd node-js-sample
    $ git remote add dokku dokku@dokku-alt.com:node-js-app
    $ git push dokku master

    -----> Resolving engine versions

    ... blah blah blah ...

    -----> Application deployed:
           http://node-js-app.progriumapp.com

You're done!

Right now Buildstep supports buildpacks for Node.js, Ruby, Python, [and more](https://github.com/progrium/buildstep#supported-buildpacks). It's not hard to add more, [go add more](https://github.com/progrium/buildstep#adding-buildpacks)!
Please check the documentation for your particular build pack as you may need to include configuration files (such as a Procfile) in your project root.

## Dokku-alt-manager (BETA)

It's web interface to easily manage your dokku-alt instance. Simply run to install manager:

    dokku manager:install

Anytime you can enable or disable it:

    dokku manager:enable
    dokku manager:disable

Or even uninstall if you prefer command line access (it will also wipe used database):

    dokku manager:uninstall

## Dockerfile images

The key feature of the `dokku-alt` is built-in support for Dockerfiles, the docker build process. It allows you to create more advanced and more repetitive application environments.
To use `Dockerfile` simply put `Dockerfile` in root of the application, `dokku-alt` will detect it and build application according to specification in `Dockerfile`.

Dockerfile-based application can (but not required) to expose web-application port. `dokku-alt` will check if 80, 8080, 5000 is exposed. If it's it will update assign vhost and reconfigure nginx to forward all incoming traffic.

Using dockerfile you can built service-only applications. Simply don't expose public facing ports.

Example Dockerfile application: https://github.com/ayufan/dokku-alt-phpmyadmin

## Nginx and redirects

Dokku-alt has built-in support for additional domains and url redirects. By specifying redirects any client using that address will automatically be redirected to first domain assigned to the application.

## Remote commands

Dokku commands can be run over ssh. Anywhere you would run `dokku <command>`, just run `ssh -t dokku@progriumapp.com <command>`
The `-t` is used to request a pty. It is highly recommended to do so.
To avoid the need to type the `-t` option each time, simply create/modify a section in the `.ssh/config` on the client side, as follows :

    Host progriumapp.com
    RequestTTY yes

## Run a command in the app environment

It's possible to run commands in the environment of the deployed application:

    $ dokku run node-js-app ls -alh
    $ dokku run <app> <cmd>

## Removing a deployed app

SSH onto the server, then execute:

    $ dokku delete myapp

## Create-only application

Dokku-alt allows you to create application before pushing it. It can be useful when you want to specify additional config variables or assign databases. Simply execute:

    $ dokku create mynewapp

There's also possiblity to disable auto-application creation on push. Add to `~/dokkurc`:

    export DOKKU_DISABLE_AUTO_APP_CREATE=1

From now on you will have to do `dokku create` at first.

## Allowing push-access (deploy only) access for dokku

Dokku-alt allows you to add additional public keys to applications. The specific case is to add special deploy-only key, used for example by Countinous Integration (ie. Jenkins). Key added as deploy-only can only be used to `git push` specific application. It will not allowed to execute any on `dokku` commands. You can add ssh key and allow it explicit access to one or many applications.

Add locally:

    $ cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | dokku deploy:allow myapp

Add key remotely:

    $ cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh dokku@dokku deploy:allow myapp

To later revoke key execute:

    $ dokku deploy:revoke myapp FINGERPRINT

You can also list all fingerprints allowed to deploy an application:

    $ dokku deploy:list myapp

Add a new admin user:

    $ cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | dokku access:add

Revoke permissions for admin user:

    $ dokku access:revoke FINGERPRINT

## Environment variable management

Typically an application will require some environment variables to run properly. Environment variables may contain private data, such as passwords or API keys, so it is not recommend to store them in your application's repository.

The `config` plugin provides the following commands to manage your variables:
```
config <app> - display the config vars for an app
config:get <app> KEY - display a config value for an app
config:set <app> KEY1=VALUE1 [KEY2=VALUE2 ...] - set one or more config vars
config:unset <app> KEY1 [KEY2 ...] - unset one or more config vars
```

### Available environment variables

* `DOKKU_NGINX_PROXY_READ_TIMEOUT` (BETA) - allows to override `nginx proxy_read_timeout`. Default value is set to '60s'. For more info please refer to: http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_read_timeout.
* `DOKKU_ENABLE_HTTP_HOST` - when set to 1 application will also serve content on HTTP if HTTPS is enabled
* `DOKKU_BUILDSTEP_IMAGE` (BETA) - allows you to set custom buildstep image on per app basis. Image has to be compatible with https://github.com/progrium/buildstep or https://github.com/dokku-alt/progrium-buildstep-dockerfiles. In case of image forked from https://github.com/progrium/buildstep there might be small incompatibility: image is run with `/start` instead of `/start web` as in orginal `dokku`.

## Image tagging

When you successfully deploy an app, you can tag it with your name and later in case of failure quickly revert back to that image.

    $ dokku tag:add gitlab v6.9.0
    =====> Tagged latest image of dokku/gitlab as v6.9.0
    $ dokku tag:list gitlab
    REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             VIRTUAL SIZE
    dokku/gitlab        build               fc3baf1216d2        4 weeks ago         954.9 MB
    dokku/gitlab        latest              fc3baf1216d2        4 weeks ago         954.9 MB
    dokku/gitlab        release             fc3baf1216d2        4 weeks ago         954.9 MB
    dokku/gitlab        v6.9.0              fc3baf1216d2        4 weeks ago         954.9 MB
    $ dokku deploy gitlab release <-- it will deploy GIT head
    $ dokku deploy gitlab v6.9.0 <-- it will deploy tagged image

## Databases

Dokku-alt has built-in support for all modern database engines: MariaDB (former MySQL), PostgreSQL and MongoDB. The database image will be downloaded and provisioned when first used.

First create database:

    $ dokku mariadb:create test-db
    -----> MariaDB database created: test-db

Second link database to an app:

    $ dokku mariadb:link node-js-sample test-db
    -----> Releasing node-js-sample ...
    -----> Deploying node-js-sample ...
    -----> Shutting down old containers
    =====> Application deployed:
        http://node-js-sample.ayufan.eu

Verify application env variables:

    $ dokku config node-js-sample
    === node-js-sample config vars ===
    DATABASE_URL:  mysql2://node-js-sample:random-password@mariadb:3306/test-db

To use different database engine simple replace `mariadb` with `postgresql` or `mongodb`.

## Preboot / zero-downtime boot

Similar to functionality provided by https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/labs-preboot `dokku-alt` supports zero-downtime. To enable zero-downtime deployment execute command: `dokku preboot:enable APP`. Alongside with preboot there's `checks` plugin based on https://labnotes.org/zero-downtime-deploy-with-dokku/. For now it simply checks if application started serving requests. If checks module fails it will not replace the application.

Preboot and checks can be configured using a few env variables:

* PREBOOT_WAIT_TIME - number of seconds to wait for container boot (default 5s)
* PREBOOT_COOLDOWN_TIME - number of seconds to wait finish container request processing (default 30s)
* DOKKU_CHECKS_WAIT - number of seconds to wait before request retries (default 10s)
* DOKKU_CHECKS_TIMEOUT - number of seconds to wait for each response (default 20s)
* DOKKU_CHECKS_RETRY - number of retries (default 3)

## Data volumes

Docker allows you to have persistent data storage. Dokku-alt exposes this feature as Data Volumes. You can create unlimited number of data volumes, any data volume can be attached to unlimited number of apps. Simply create data volume and specify container paths which you want to be persistant.

First data volume:

    $ dokku volume:create shared-test-volume /app/logs /app/tmp /app/uploads
    -----> Volume created: volume_data_shared-test-volume

Second link volume to an app:

    $ dokku volume:link node-js-sample shared-test-volume
    -----> Volume shared-test-volume linked to an aplication: node-js-sample
    -----> Releasing node-js-sample ...
    -----> Deploying node-js-sample ...
    -----> Shutting down old containers
    =====> Application deployed:
        http://node-js-sample.ayufan.eu

It is just simple as this.

### Host-based volumes

Dokku-alt allows you to bind host-based volumes in very simple manner. To use this feature you have to be logged as `root` and than simply type:

    dokku volume:create host-based-volume /path/to/host/volume:/path/to/volume/in/container

## HTTP-Basic Auth support

Dokku-alt allows you to secure any application with HTTP-Basic Auth. There are a few commands that makes it happen:

    htpasswd:add <app> <user>                       Add http-basic auth user
    htpasswd:disable <app>                          Remove http-basic Auth
    htpasswd:remove <app> <user>                    Remove user

If you want to enable and add a new user simply type command below and when prompted type your password twice:

    dokku htpasswd:add myapp myuser

You can also pipe password:

    echo mypass | dokku htpasswd:add myapp myuser

To revoke user's permission:

    dokku htpasswd:remove myapp

To remove HTTP-Basic Auth completely:

    dokku htpasswd:disable myapp

## TLS support

Dokku provides easy TLS support from the box. To enable TLS connection to your application, copy the `.crt` and `.key` files into the `/home/dokku/:app/ssl` folder (notice, file names should be `server.crt` and `server.key`, respectively). Redeployment of the application will be needed to apply TLS configuration. Once it is redeployed, the application will be accessible by `https://` (redirection from `http://` is applied as well).

## TLS support

Dokku-alt extends this even further by allowing you to use command line interface for certificates:

    ssl:generate <app>                              Generate certificate signing request for an APP
    ssl:certificate <app>                           Pipe signed certifcate with all intermediates for an APP
    ssl:forget <app>                                Wipes certificate for an APP
    ssl:info <app>                                  Show info about certifcate and certificate request
    ssl:key <app>                                   Pipe private key for an APP

First use: `dokku ssl:generate myapp` to generate certificate signing request (CSR). At the end of process you will receive `BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST` which you can ten copy-n-paste to your SSL signer (ie. http://startssl.com).

When you receive your signed certificate pipe it with **ALL INTERMEDIATES** to `dokku ssl:certificate myapp`. If done correctly you have SSL enabled for your site.

    cat mycert.pem intermediate.pem ca.pem | dokku ssl:certificate myapp

If it happens that you have already created certificate you can use it, by piping your **UNENCRYPTED** your certificate and your private key:

    cat mycert.pem intermediate.pem ca.pem | dokku ssl:certificate myapp
    cat mycert.key | dokku ssl:key myapp

To view asigned certificate:

    dokku ssl:info myapp

## HSTS support

HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a web security policy mechanism whereby a web server declares that complying user agents (such as a web browser) are to interact with it using only secure HTTPS connections. Once enabled all further communication will be done over TLS only, there's no revert mechanism. As this is additional security feature you have to do it by hand. To enable HSTS for site use:

    dokku config:set myapp DOKKU_ENABLE_HSTS=1

## Serve an app over HTTP as well

By default `dokku-alt` for all TLS-enabled apps will create redirects which requires user to use `https://`. In some cases it maybe required to allow `http://` access which is potentially insecure. To enable simulatenous HTTP and HTTPS set specific config:

    dokku config:set myapp DOKKU_ENABLE_HTTP_HOST=1

## dokkurc Configuration

You can fine-tune some aspects of Dokku behaviour and its plugins by setting variables in `dokkurc` file placed in Dokku root directory – usually `/home/dokku`. `dokkurc` is sourced by the main `dokku` script.

Example:

    export DOKKU_DISABLE_AUTO_APP_CREATE=1
    export BUILDSTEP_IMAGE="ayufan/dokku-alt-buildstep:foreman"

### Fix Shellshock vulnerability

Shellshock (CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-7169, CVE-2014-7186, CVE-2014-7187) is a vulnerability in GNU's bash shell that gives attackers access to run remote commands on a vulnerable system. More info you can find there: https://shellshocker.net/.

1. `sudo dokku plugins-install`
2. If you use Dockerfile you need for every app which uses it redownload image names used by `FROM`. Then issue docker pull every image used by FROM: `docker pull ubuntu:trusty`. You don't have to do it for buildstep-based images, it were done by `plugins-install`. Please check `Dockerfile` of the app:

        FROM ubuntu:trusty
        RUN ...

    Then run in server's terminal: `docker pull ubuntu:trusty`

3. Rebuild all applications with cache wipe: `dokku rebuild:all:force`.
4. Voila. Your are secure!
